# Flame Internal Documentation.

This is how to use the Flame Internal GUI.

1. Execute the loadstring:
```lua
local lp = game.Players.LocalPlayer
lp:Kick("The Flame Internal Has Not Been Released Yet, It will release 1-14d from now.")
```

2. Use the GUI freely!
```
DOCUMENTATION IS MISSING AS FLAME IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT.
